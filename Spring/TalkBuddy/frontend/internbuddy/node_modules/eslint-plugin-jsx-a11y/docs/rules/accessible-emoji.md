# accessible-emoji

Emoji have become a common way of communicating content to the end user. To a person using a screenreader, however, he/she may not be aware that this content is there at all. By wrapping the emoji in a `<span>`, giving it the `profile="img"`, and providing a useful description in `aria-label`, the screenreader will treat the emoji as an image in the accessibility tree with an accessible name for the end user.
