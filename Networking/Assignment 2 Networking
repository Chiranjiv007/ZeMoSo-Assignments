Explain what and how the below command does what it does:

printf 'HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: en.wikipedia.org (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.\r\n\r\n' | nc en.wikipedia.org (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. 80
Your answer:
The printf command is used to frame the HTTP header manually in the required format. As we can see the HTTP header has a Host field which indicates to what address the request is to be sent, in this case en.wikipedia.org, the formatted header from the printf's output is then handed over to the netcat(nc) command.

The netcat command is used to send a string of characters to a destination host on a particular port by using TCP. In this case the host is en.wikipedia.org and the port being used is 80 (Which is the port for sending HTTP traffic). 

The result is that effectively we are sending a HTTP header to the en.wikipedia.org  site and we get back a response from the website as like below:

HTTP/1.1 400 
Date: Fri, 14 Jun 2019 09:15:54 GMT
Server: Varnish
X-Varnish: 1005862476
X-Cache: cp5008 int
X-Cache-Status: int-front
Server-Timing: cache;desc="int-front"

Set-Cookie: WMF-Last-Access-Global=14-Jun-2019;Path=/;Domain=.invalid;HttpOnly;secure;Expires=Tue, 16 Jul 2019 00:00:00 GMT
X-Client-IP: 
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 1793
Via: HTTP/1.1 forward.http.proxy:3128
Connection: keep-alive

This includes information like Server which handled the request, cookies info and other metadata like date and time at which request was made etc.

Once the response is received nc closes the terminal

How will you modify the above command to fetch the contents of www.rediff.com (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. ?

Your answer:
printf 'HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.rediff.com \r\n\r\n' | nc www.rediff.com 80
